## General info
Start collecting points by rolling the dice. 
But keep in mind that if you roll the dice and get a 1, you will lose all the points you have collected and your opponent will take the turn. 
That's why it's so important when you decide to stop rolling the dice and keep your points :). 
When you keep your points, your opponent will also turn to your opponent, and whoever gets 100 points in total will win the game. 
Have fun :)
